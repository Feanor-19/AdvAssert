# AdvAssert
Second educational project in MIPT. An attempt to implement advanced version of assert().

## Brief description
Implements define ADV_ASSERT(), which can be used instead of standard assert(). 
It allows you to pass variables in a certain way, and their values will be printed when given condition turns out to be false (like in a standard assert).
If you want to try it out, please check source files and docs in 'doxygen' for more information!

## Usage
As is it is one of the first projects, it is not supposed to be used in real projects. But it can be useful for beginners like me: almost everything is documented, also you can check doxygen docs 
in order to learn something new.
